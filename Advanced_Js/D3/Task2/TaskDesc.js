    *Create your box object that contains books objects, ensure that you can
        * Create book object and add it to box object content property
        * Count # of books inside box 
        * Delete any of these books in box according to book title.
        
        Note: You should delete a single copy of the books with the same title.
        * Create Class Property that counts numbers of created books objects and Class method to retrieve it. 
        & Use .toString() to display the box instance’s dimensions and how books are stored in it. 
        & Implement .valueof() so that 
            ? if there is more than one box object we can get total number of books in these boxes by adding them
            * i.e. if box1 has 5 books and box2 has 2 books,
            * then box1 + box2 should return 7

        * * Note:
            * There is no inheritance
            * Using of global variables, Class methods and properties isn’t allowed.
            * Box object has the following properties:
                * height, width, length, material, content. 
                * The content property contains an array books 
            
            * Book object has the following properties:
                * title, numofChapters, author, numofPages, publisher, numofCopies
                * You should use accessor and/or data descriptor for defining properties,
                * and if needed, prevent them from being deleted, iterated or being modified.
            
            * you can define any function needed for both box and book 
            object
