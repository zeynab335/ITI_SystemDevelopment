    *A.1. Make your own custom Object that simulates the linked list 
        * that accepts objects with a single numeric property value in asc
        *  Let your object has the following functionalities
            
            ? Enqueue a value as long as the value is in the sequence
                ! otherwise through an exception (push an item at the end of the list with the passed value).
            
            ? Insert an item in a specific place 
                ! as long as the value is missing from the sequence otherwise through an exception.
        
            ? Pop a value (remove an item from the end of the list).
            
            ? Remove an item from a specific place with the required value
                * if the value is not added return a message with “data not found”.
            
            ? Dequeue a value (remove an item from the beginning of the list).
            ? Display the content of the list.
            ? Ensure that there is no duplication in your entered values. 
            ? You can add any property you need.
        
        * Note: Use Array Object methods and there is no need to use sort() function.
